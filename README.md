# ðŸ§  AI Workflow Assignment â€“ Patient Readmission Prediction

This project applies the AI development workflow to a real-world healthcare scenario: predicting whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days after discharge. It follows the full pipeline from problem definition to deployment and reflection, aligned with the CRISP-DM framework.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement:
A hospital aims to reduce patient readmission by predicting which discharged patients are at high risk of returning within 30 days.

### ðŸ›  Solution:
A machine learning model is built using structured data and deployed via a Flask API. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and ethical considerations.
